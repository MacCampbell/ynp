# ynp
This is a simplified version of the analysis scripts and data from Pearse and Campbell (2017). The population genetics of Yosemite National Park Rainbow Trout were examined focusing on adaptive genetic variation and ancestry.  

Here, it is modified so that it can be worked through directly and I have included tutorial scripts in general for R. This repository was presented as a workshop at SEDES International Joint Laboratory (http://sedes-ijl.com/) by Mac Campbell.

# Origins
The data are from a report examining the origins and relationships of Yosemite National Park rainbow trout (_Onchorhynchus mykiss_).

## Guidelines to Working Through
I would suggest opening a .md file as an .html and logging useful commands to a separate new .R file.
